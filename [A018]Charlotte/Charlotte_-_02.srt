1
00:00:10,375 --> 00:00:11,125
Hyaa!

2
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,375
I'm gonna go.

3
00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,350
Wait a minute!

4
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,492
You're forgetting something!

5
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:19,325
Your lunch!

6
00:00:19,325 --> 00:00:21,050
What's the menu today?

7
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:22,594
It's omelet rice, your favorite.

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,596
That again?!

9
00:00:25,425 --> 00:00:27,595
Th‐Thanks. Now don't to be late, OK?

10
00:00:27,595 --> 00:00:28,766
I won't.

11
00:02:04,475 --> 00:02:05,526
Please excuse me.

12
00:02:06,038 --> 00:02:07,925
Welcome to our academy.

13
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,250
So every single student here has some special ability?

14
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:23,620
No. Some have the possibility of having one,

15
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,175
and some show signs of developing one.

16
00:02:26,175 --> 00:02:28,378
You transfer them here just for that?

17
00:02:28,378 --> 00:02:31,710
A long time ago,   people who had special abilities like we have

18
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:36,526
could end up as guinea pigs for misguided   and sometimes cruel neuroscientists.

19
00:02:36,526 --> 00:02:39,675
If you got caught, your life was basically over.

20
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:42,250
Hah! You're exaggerating.

21
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,337
I'm actually talking about my big brother.

22
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,700
To protect those with abilities,

23
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,570
a certain individual created the current system,

24
00:02:51,570 --> 00:02:53,672
though not in time to save my big brother.

25
00:02:53,672 --> 00:02:56,275
So why did you get me into this student council

26
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,600
and tell me I should use my powers?

27
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,775
The student council here is entrusted with a special mission,

28
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:04,766
and that is to seek out those with special abilities

29
00:03:04,766 --> 00:03:06,468
who are on the loose, like you were,

30
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:10,071
and either protect them   or threaten them to never use their powers.

31
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:11,939
Why would I do something like that?

32
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:15,109
In return, you will be paid appropriately.

33
00:03:15,109 --> 00:03:18,612
Isn't Ayumi having to   do her best to make decent meals every day

34
00:03:18,612 --> 00:03:21,400
because you can't even afford to buy proper food?

35
00:03:25,025 --> 00:03:27,025
My name is Yu Otosaka.

36
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:29,761
I came here from Hinomori High School.

37
00:03:29,761 --> 00:03:31,584
Nice to meet you all.

38
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:34,760
So cute!

39
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,925
Hey. She's a first‐year, but she's student council president?

40
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:55,875
Right. In this academy, the student council president

41
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,615
is not determined by grade.

42
00:03:57,615 --> 00:04:00,350
It goes to someone who's active and has a sense of duty

43
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,875
as someone with a special ability.

44
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,653
 I see.

45
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,825
This is exactly the same thing as last night's dinner.

46
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:13,975
Say, Otosaka, what are you going to do about lunch today?

47
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,200
Well, I don't have anything.

48
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,475
Then let's go to the cafeteria together.

49
00:04:18,475 --> 00:04:19,977
I'll show you where it is.

50
00:04:19,977 --> 00:04:21,743
That would be a big help.

51
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,302
You're not going to invite her?

52
00:04:25,302 --> 00:04:27,795
I can ask her to come along if you like.

53
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,675
Nah. No thanks.

54
00:04:33,525 --> 00:04:35,760
Doesn't seem to be any open seats.

55
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,019
Then how about we buy some sandwiches

56
00:04:38,019 --> 00:04:39,575
and go back to the classroom to eat?

57
00:04:39,575 --> 00:04:42,115
 Well, it's pretty crowded over there, too.

58
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,348
Just leave that part to me.

59
00:04:44,348 --> 00:04:46,450
Here's where I can show off my ability.

60
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,375
Is it OK for you to do that? 

61
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:49,770
Don't worry, it's fine.

62
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:51,882
I'll go in from the blind spot on the camera.

63
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:54,452
Though, since I'll be going by too quickly,

64
00:04:54,452 --> 00:04:58,350
what kind of breads I grab will all depend on luck.

65
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,383
Huh?

66
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:00,750
Hey.

67
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,150
What was that?

68
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:28,372
An explosion?

69
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:29,716
Sorry to make you wait.

70
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:34,325
Oh, I got a rather great result this time.

71
00:05:34,325 --> 00:05:35,275
A cutlet sandwich.

72
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:36,050
What?

73
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,928
You call that a great result with all those wounds on you?

74
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:41,450
I do wear armor under my uniform

75
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:43,664
so the wounds are never very deep, youknow.

76
00:05:44,525 --> 00:05:46,800
But you're bleeding from your head!

77
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:51,227
You know, you're a pretty dangerous guy, despite how yolook.

78
00:05:51,227 --> 00:05:52,827
What do you mean by that?

79
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,030
Wait, you have nothing but cutlet sandwiches here.

80
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,775
It's teleportation, you know.

81
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:00,343
You think I had time to pick and choose what I wanted?

82
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:02,767
And every single one of them is smushed.

83
00:06:02,767 --> 00:06:04,100
That's teleportation.

84
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:08,159
You think I can fine‐tune how forcefully I grab merchandise

85
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,763
when I'm moving that fast?

86
00:06:09,763 --> 00:06:12,475
His ability really is half‐assed.

87
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:16,650
She doesn't have any female friends,

88
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,698
even though she's the student council president?

89
00:06:18,698 --> 00:06:20,633
Her special ability is to become

90
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:23,050
completely invisible to one person she chooses.

91
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,525
Which means that everyone other than that person can see her.

92
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:31,078
That imperfection is what caused the situation she's in right now.

93
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Even if she had a valid reason,

94
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,775
what would people around her think

95
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:39,183
after seeing her use her ability to take violent actions?

96
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:43,575
On top of that, the surveillance cameras

97
00:06:43,575 --> 00:06:45,444
show nothing but an ordinary fight.

98
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,402
As she kept doing things like that,

99
00:06:47,402 --> 00:06:50,225
obviously people eventually came to hate her.

100
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:54,054
But apparently her personality wasn't like that

101
00:06:54,054 --> 00:06:55,789
until she got into middle school.

102
00:06:56,275 --> 00:06:57,075
Huh? 

103
00:06:57,075 --> 00:06:59,275
Oh. She's walking over here.

104
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,194
A helper will soon be showing up.

105
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,875
What the hell? ‐That means, everyone gather at the student council room.

106
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,500
Huh? How did yofigure that?

107
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,247
What in the world is about to begin here?

108
00:07:34,525 --> 00:07:36,250
Who is this guy?

109
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,587
Thoughtography... right here.

110
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,075
Huh?

111
00:07:53,357 --> 00:07:54,150
Who was that?

112
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,785
A comrade who tells us the location and power

113
00:07:56,785 --> 00:07:58,961
of someone who possesses a special ability.

114
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,436
Nanba High School, We'll go stake it out.

115
00:08:02,436 --> 00:08:03,875
Come on, we're leaving early.

116
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:04,987
To do what?

117
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:07,089
Some investigation, of course.

118
00:08:07,089 --> 00:08:08,957
Even though we're not with the police?

119
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:11,927
If the police you mention find this person before we do,

120
00:08:11,927 --> 00:08:14,364
that person's life is all but over.

121
00:08:15,355 --> 00:08:16,571
Seriously?

122
00:08:17,775 --> 00:08:19,500
Start asking around.

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,700
Right!

124
00:08:21,525 --> 00:08:23,550
Come on, now. Let's get started.

125
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,500
What is it I should be doing?

126
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:29,470
Basically, ask whether anything strange has been going on lately.

127
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:32,964
Also, since the ability has been determined to be thoughtography,

128
00:08:32,964 --> 00:08:35,652
it might be good to ask about any rumors that involve photographs.

129
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,175
Very funny.

130
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:38,550
Good luck.

131
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:41,119
What am I doing?

132
00:08:41,119 --> 00:08:44,125
Those two are nothing more than a couple of lunatics.

133
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:50,918
There was someone acting suspicious.

134
00:08:50,918 --> 00:08:54,288
I want you to take over his body and look through all of his belongings.

135
00:08:54,288 --> 00:08:55,590
For what purpose?

136
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,975
To protect the one with special abilities.

137
00:09:03,525 --> 00:09:04,826
Oh, fine. Which guy is it?

138
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:07,262
Damn it, you took so long, I've lost him.

139
00:09:07,262 --> 00:09:08,100
Follow me!

140
00:09:13,325 --> 00:09:14,549
That's the guy. ‐[suspect whimpering]

141
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,375
Hurry! 

142
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,304
Damn it. Why do I have to do something like this?

143
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,100
Huh? Hey.

144
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,475
Whaaaa!

145
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,660
What's this? Whoa!

146
00:09:39,172 --> 00:09:40,619
Hey, what are you doing with that?

147
00:09:40,619 --> 00:09:42,219
Pictures of a female student.

148
00:09:42,675 --> 00:09:44,011
She's rather pretty.

149
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:47,659
Next up, well, a girl in her lingerie.

150
00:09:48,175 --> 00:09:49,693
This is thoughtography?

151
00:09:49,693 --> 00:09:51,950
You sure use it for something stupid.

152
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,261
Did you take either of these pictures?

153
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,981
No, no. I bought them.

154
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,787
Then who did you buy them from?

155
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:03,779
Look, I don't intend on leaking any of what you tell me to a third party, OK?

156
00:10:04,425 --> 00:10:06,568
Please just tell me the truth.

157
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:10,799
If you don't tell us now, I'll tell the girl in this photograph

158
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,500
that this was in your possession and that you took it.

159
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,902
Udoh... in class 2‐E.

160
00:10:16,902 --> 00:10:19,772
Thank you very much. OK, we're going in.

161
00:10:19,813 --> 00:10:21,975
We're gonna go capture Udoh from 2‐E.

162
00:10:21,975 --> 00:10:22,757
Right!

163
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:24,700
Huh?

164
00:10:26,213 --> 00:10:28,325
Can you tell me if Udoh has gone home yet?

165
00:10:28,925 --> 00:10:31,750
[girl] Huh? No, Udoh is...

166
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,516
Captain, if I may excuse myself.

167
00:10:34,516 --> 00:10:36,451
Yeah. Good work today.

168
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,127
Wow, this is a surprise. ‐[gasp]

169
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,950
Who are you? Where did you come from? 

170
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:50,173
Who would have thought that the culprit

171
00:10:50,173 --> 00:10:54,013
who takes lewd, perverted photographs like   this with his thoughtography ability

172
00:10:54,013 --> 00:10:56,025
and sells them off to his classmates

173
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,805
is also the school's archery team captain?

174
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:03,675
Photograph? Thoughtography?

175
00:11:03,675 --> 00:11:05,359
I don't know what you mean.

176
00:11:05,359 --> 00:11:07,919
Forget it. One of your customers gave you up.

177
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,322
Oh, yeah, we took a really good look inside your locker, too.

178
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:14,319
A ton of photos came falling out so I recorded them all

179
00:11:14,319 --> 00:11:16,239
on this video camera as evidence.

180
00:11:18,607 --> 00:11:21,877
I can easily open something like a locker inside a clubhouse.

181
00:11:24,239 --> 00:11:25,935
Why would youbdo such a thing?

182
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:28,350
Because I can make money with it, of course.

183
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:30,825
This involves your family's finances?

184
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:34,850
Your parents wouldn't be happy with you making money like this, you know.

185
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:37,556
They're sick, OK? There's nothing else I can do!

186
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,993
I projected you in your underwear here.

187
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:44,527
It includes your face.

188
00:11:44,527 --> 00:11:46,986
If you don't want this photo distributed everywhere,

189
00:11:46,986 --> 00:11:48,435
you'll forget this ever happened.

190
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:50,803
That's all thoughtography takes?

191
00:11:50,803 --> 00:11:51,699
I'm impressed.

192
00:11:52,025 --> 00:11:54,195
But, um, no one would ever need that.

193
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:56,819
No matter who looks at you, you're attractive.

194
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,273
Seriously? I got a compliment!

195
00:12:00,273 --> 00:12:01,475
All right!

196
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:04,370
Yeah, so hurry up and get outta here.

197
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,362
Nice work.

198
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,419
The photo is... gone?

199
00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:14,738
It's right here.

200
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:17,287
But wait, how did you...?

201
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,044
Oh, man!

202
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:20,953
That's checkmate.

203
00:12:21,225 --> 00:12:22,575
Just give up, OK?

204
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,175
Pretend like none of this ever happened.

205
00:12:29,067 --> 00:12:31,550
You're the worst kind of person, you know that?

206
00:12:32,331 --> 00:12:35,575
So how much martial arts spirit you possess means nothing!

207
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,050
Just so you know, we really don't plan

208
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,166
on handing you over to the police or anything like that.

209
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,319
However, if you keep using those powers,

210
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:02,175
your life will be completely ruined.

211
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,746
Do you want to become an experimental subject dissected by scientists?

212
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,635
Dissected? ‐So this is a warning.

213
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,600
Those powers will disappear once your body is finished with adolescence.

214
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,888
As for money, earn some by working legitimate part‐time jobs.

215
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,607
We took care of that successfully.

216
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,025
Indeed, we did.

217
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,019
Tell me, you guys always do things like this?

218
00:13:35,019 --> 00:13:40,124
Yes. So that no one   with special abilities ends up like my big brother.

219
00:13:40,124 --> 00:13:44,750
I see. So what is it, exactly, that actually happened to your big brother

220
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,520
after he got caught by the scientists?

221
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,900
 It's not like I'm hiding him or anything.

222
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,576
How about we visit tomorrow?

223
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,850
Huh? Visit where?

224
00:13:54,392 --> 00:13:55,900
Where my big brother is now.

225
00:13:58,936 --> 00:14:00,438
OK, are you ready to go?

226
00:14:00,438 --> 00:14:02,775
Yeah. What about you?

227
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:05,125
I'm going to take a pass this time.

228
00:14:05,885 --> 00:14:06,675
Take care.

229
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,685
You haven't eaten lunch yet, have you?

230
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:10,850
No.

231
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,600
Then let's buy station‐specific lunches at the kiosk!

232
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,331
I want this one!

233
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:17,569
A beef‐tongue bento box lunch

234
00:14:17,569 --> 00:14:18,787
that warms up when you pull a string!

235
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,125
This is totally amazing!

236
00:14:21,125 --> 00:14:22,527
Yeah, I know all about them.

237
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,794
I can't believe it, this is so embarrassing.

238
00:14:30,794 --> 00:14:34,058
How can she eat like that in a situation like this?

239
00:14:35,658 --> 00:14:38,026
It's bad manners, no matter how you look at it.

240
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,150
What's wrong? Aren't you gonna eat the sandwich yobought?

241
00:14:41,475 --> 00:14:43,018
Ahhhhh...

242
00:14:49,262 --> 00:14:52,654
 My big brother was the first to have a special ability.

243
00:14:52,654 --> 00:14:54,725
I'd just passed the middle school entrance exams

244
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:57,570
for a national university magnet school.

245
00:14:59,225 --> 00:15:00,375
I did it, Mom!

246
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,377
I did it! I got accepted!

247
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,950
You really did do your best now.

248
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,900
That means you could end up being a doctor, or even a minister.

249
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,353
Yup!

250
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,641
Big Brother, look at this. I got accepted.

251
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:17,445
Seriously? Unlike me, you're completely amazing, you know?

252
00:15:17,445 --> 00:15:20,214
No, you're much more amazing than me, Big Brother.

253
00:15:20,214 --> 00:15:22,742
I heard that some of the record companies

254
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:24,944
are starting to notice what a great band you have.

255
00:15:24,944 --> 00:15:27,280
Since we're poor, I want to hurry up and land myself

256
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:29,782
a major record deal so I can live on my own.

257
00:15:30,045 --> 00:15:32,848
Hey, did you ever listen to that CD I lent you?

258
00:15:32,848 --> 00:15:35,951
It would get in the way of my studies, so no, I haven't.

259
00:15:35,951 --> 00:15:38,887
Your entrance exams are over now so listen to it.

260
00:15:38,887 --> 00:15:41,823
I want to create sounds just like it and soar to the top.

261
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,592
 I'm not really interested in rock music and stuff.

262
00:15:44,592 --> 00:15:47,928
It's different. Zhiend is not rock music, it's post‐rock.

263
00:15:47,928 --> 00:15:50,125
You said that before, too.

264
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,610
Like, I don't understand what you mean at all.

265
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:56,787
As it turned out, I wasn't able to enter that school.

266
00:15:58,072 --> 00:16:00,150
I have something important to say.

267
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,650
I've decided to enter you both in a boarding school

268
00:16:03,650 --> 00:16:06,825
so that each of you has the chance to develop your special talents.

269
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,050
Huh?

270
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,150
What do you mean?

271
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,175
I was just about to sign to a record label.

272
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:14,618
I'm sorry, but can't you put that off

273
00:16:14,618 --> 00:16:15,578
for just a little while?

274
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,719
I don't get any of this!

275
00:16:17,719 --> 00:16:21,575
If I can support myself, that will take the pressure off our money situation!

276
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:23,110
It's actually the reverse.

277
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,113
We'll be better off financially if your guys go to this school...

278
00:16:26,113 --> 00:16:27,627
What do you mean, the reverse?

279
00:16:27,627 --> 00:16:29,769
In the first place, Nao is good at studying,

280
00:16:29,769 --> 00:16:32,700
but I'm just an idiot who only knows how to play the guitar!

281
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,450
I think that's exactly what they acknowledged you for.

282
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,769
Then is that place a specialized school for music?

283
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:39,898
What's up with us both going together?

284
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:43,975
That day, we saw my mother

285
00:16:43,975 --> 00:16:47,225
grovel on the ground and beg for the first time in our lives.

286
00:16:47,925 --> 00:16:51,000
My mother, who raised us for the longest time,

287
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,334
all by herself.

288
00:16:52,625 --> 00:16:54,725
It looked like a fairly normal school,

289
00:16:54,725 --> 00:16:57,150
and I immediately made a few friends.

290
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:00,471
However, every day after classes were over,

291
00:17:00,471 --> 00:17:03,185
I was forced to take something like a physical exam.

292
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:05,975
We were supposedly in the same school,

293
00:17:05,975 --> 00:17:08,177
but I couldn't see my brother at all.

294
00:17:08,727 --> 00:17:11,600
Every time I tried to go and look for him,

295
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,844
my friends would always stop me from doing so.

296
00:17:14,487 --> 00:17:16,468
What I didn't know was that my brother

297
00:17:16,468 --> 00:17:18,644
had been turned into an experimental subject.

298
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:24,100
My brother's special ability was to make air vibrate to his will.

299
00:17:24,675 --> 00:17:27,661
He used that ability during a live performance

300
00:17:27,661 --> 00:17:30,250
to change the sound of his guitar in unusual ways.

301
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:32,125
That's how they found him.

302
00:17:32,808 --> 00:17:34,792
Scientists believed that my brother's ability

303
00:17:34,792 --> 00:17:37,350
could be harnessed to disrupt communications

304
00:17:37,544 --> 00:17:39,850
or even jack the airwaves if focused correctly.

305
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:44,500
A year later, I was finally allowed to see my brother,

306
00:17:44,627 --> 00:17:47,500
but he was no longer the big brother I remembered.

307
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:51,250
He couldn't even recognize that I was his little sister.

308
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,984
His memories were gone.

309
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,525
The classmates that had been keeping me away from my brother

310
00:17:57,525 --> 00:17:59,262
were placed around me by the scientists

311
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:00,670
to pretend to be my friends.

312
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:03,742
The reason they were examining me every day

313
00:18:03,742 --> 00:18:06,144
was because, if one sibling has an ability,

314
00:18:06,425 --> 00:18:08,925
chances are that the other one will, too.

315
00:18:09,275 --> 00:18:11,550
And that was the only reason.

316
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,650
I swore that I wouldn't trust anyone ever again.

317
00:18:17,028 --> 00:18:18,800
I snuck out of that school.

318
00:18:22,148 --> 00:18:24,075
What happened after you left there?

319
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:27,225
I met the one person I could truly trust,

320
00:18:27,225 --> 00:18:28,900
and that's how I'm here now.

321
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,632
That person is...?

322
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,325
Oh. We're getting off here.

323
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,850
I'm Nao Tomori. I'm here to see my brother.

324
00:18:42,841 --> 00:18:44,725
So her first name is "Nao."

325
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,994
He's in room 12. Go ahead.

326
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:49,561
Think it would be OK if I took him outside?

327
00:18:49,561 --> 00:18:52,697
As long as you keep to our grounds, no problem.

328
00:18:52,697 --> 00:18:53,725
Thank you so much.

329
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:56,989
This way.

330
00:18:59,925 --> 00:19:00,875
He's here.

331
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:07,975
Hmm?

332
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:17,150
Guess the painkillers have worn off again.

333
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,718
Your brother.

334
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,794
What in the world is he doing?

335
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:22,125
He's composing.

336
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:25,875
My brother thinks that he's actually playing a guitar.

337
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:28,586
All of those grunts and groans you hear

338
00:19:28,586 --> 00:19:30,350
is him singing the main melody.

339
00:19:32,425 --> 00:19:32,975
Oh!

340
00:19:34,725 --> 00:19:37,800
Oh, man. He ruined another comforter.

341
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,525
Would you like to go outside?

342
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:44,225
It's the time of day when you see the best scenery.

343
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,500
It's amazing.

344
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,375
Isn't it, though?

345
00:20:00,525 --> 00:20:03,512
Yeah. But an environment this special,

346
00:20:03,512 --> 00:20:04,984
how in the world did you pull it off?

347
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,025
It's all thanks to the one person I can trust.

348
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:10,812
He transferred my brother to the hospital

349
00:20:10,812 --> 00:20:13,350
in this beautiful place free of charge.

350
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:16,950
There's actually someone out there that generous?

351
00:20:20,850 --> 00:20:22,419
He shows no interest at all.

352
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,653
But maybe someday someone will come up with a miracle drug

353
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:26,523
that can cure this.

354
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:29,626
Nobody is doing research on how to save patients like this.

355
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,533
Well, why not?

356
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:33,750
For the scientists,

357
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:36,323
people that have abilities are just like batteries.

358
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:38,125
If one runs out of power,

359
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,225
they can just experiment with another.

360
00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:43,311
There's no incentive for them to help the test subjects

361
00:20:43,311 --> 00:20:44,207
that end up like this.

362
00:20:44,575 --> 00:20:45,697
I'm stunned.

363
00:20:46,273 --> 00:20:48,242
We don't know whether or not

364
00:20:48,242 --> 00:20:49,700
something will happen to us tomorrow, either.

365
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,535
Now you're just talking crazy.

366
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,125
 How about you choose your words carefully?

367
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,575
Sorry.

368
00:20:57,575 --> 00:20:59,575
Well then, let's go back.

369
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,125
You're really having a hard time with all this, aren't you?

370
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,550
You're sympathizing?

371
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,918
Well, stop that. You're nothing but a dishonest cheater.

372
00:21:10,646 --> 00:21:11,650
She's right.

373
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:13,100
This is unlike me.

374
00:21:14,742 --> 00:21:15,725
I'm home.

375
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:21,300
I didn't think the student council would be something that keeps me this busy.

376
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:22,825
Nothing I can do about it.

377
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:23,350
Huh?

378
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,287
Big Brother, you're part of the student council?

379
00:21:26,525 --> 00:21:27,831
You mean I didn't tell you? 

380
00:21:27,831 --> 00:21:29,831
This is the first I'm hearing it!

381
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:32,900
In that case, you need to eat some of my special rolling vegetable curry

382
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,634
to renew your energy.

383
00:21:37,834 --> 00:21:39,425
If I have a special ability,

384
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:42,881
there is the possibility that Ayumi will have one, too.

385
00:21:42,881 --> 00:21:44,618
If I were to be captured,

386
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:47,678
Ayumi could end up just like Tomori.

387
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:49,625
It's done!

388
00:21:50,634 --> 00:21:51,725
It looks great.

389
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,024
I hope you really like it.

390
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,112
So sweet!

391
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:59,700
Uh, well, um, can it be that the secret ingredient of this curry is...

392
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,425
Pizza sauce: the secret ingredient of our household!

393
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:07,766
Oh, man, this tastes no different

394
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:09,686
from all the omelet rice she's made.

395
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:13,150
Wow!

396
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:16,375
I guess it's your daily routine, but hurry up and go to sleep.

397
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:19,425
I was able to see a comet today, so I'm deeply moved

398
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:21,259
and can go to sleep totally excited!

399
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:23,095
That's pretty skillful of you.

400
00:22:23,095 --> 00:22:26,350
But the comet that I really want to see is a completely different one.

401
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:29,453
Oh? ‐A comet with a really long orbit!

402
00:22:30,477 --> 00:22:31,325
What is that?

403
00:22:31,325 --> 00:22:33,475
It's a comet that swings by us only once

404
00:22:33,475 --> 00:22:35,000
every few centuries!

405
00:22:36,027 --> 00:22:37,900
They have comets like that, huh?
