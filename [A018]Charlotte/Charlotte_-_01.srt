1
00:00:15,977 --> 00:00:19,977
Since I was little,I've had a question in my mind.

2
00:00:19,977 --> 00:00:23,811
Why am I only myself and not someone else?

3
00:00:23,811 --> 00:00:25,677
I'm aware that

4
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:27,211
"I think, therefore I am"

5
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:30,177
are the words of a great ancient philosopher,

6
00:00:30,177 --> 00:00:33,177
but when I thought, I thought about someone else,

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,111
that perhaps the other person was myself, too.

8
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,500
Think about others.

9
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,543
When I did that,

10
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:00,975
I turned into someone else...

11
00:01:03,775 --> 00:01:05,975
...but for no more than five seconds.

12
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,900
Furthermore, for the duration,

13
00:01:08,525 --> 00:01:10,800
my body completely lost consciousness

14
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,100
and just collapsed wherever I stood.

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,333
I often found myself injured in some way.

16
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:19,900
And I could only possess someone   that was within my line of sight,

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
so I couldn't use it for lewd things.

18
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,350
I mostly possessed people who pissed me off,

19
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:27,283
picked a fight with a stranger, and returned to myself.

20
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,325
That kind of retaliation was all I could use this for.

21
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:35,428
Oh, that's funny!

22
00:01:37,275 --> 00:01:38,050
Huh?

23
00:01:39,425 --> 00:01:41,864
You bastard! What the hell are you doing?

24
00:01:44,175 --> 00:01:46,775
But finally, I came up with a brilliant idea

25
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:49,541
that could take full advantage of my special ability.

26
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:51,150
Hmm.

27
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:52,575
You have five minutes left.

28
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,550
I could possess one smart person in class after another,

29
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:05,983
memorize their answers, and fill in my answers after returning.

30
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:22,450
Of course, I was planning on attending   a very prestigious high school.

31
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,074
However, unlike the normal test,

32
00:02:25,074 --> 00:02:27,925
I didn't know who was intelligent during an entrance exam.

33
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,525
And so I snuck into top‐rated cram schools,

34
00:02:31,525 --> 00:02:34,975
one after another, pretending to be   one of the students attending there.

35
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:39,450
Which students applied to which schools

36
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,883
and which subjects were they best at?

37
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:45,049
I researched all of that thoroughly.

38
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:47,425
I found one student after another

39
00:02:47,425 --> 00:02:49,358
vying to enter the same school I was

40
00:02:49,358 --> 00:02:51,622
that I could possess and take answers from.

41
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,525
And I was admitted to an elite high school.

42
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:57,986
[man] Now a word from the representative for new students.

43
00:02:57,986 --> 00:02:59,900
‐Yu Otosaka, please come up.

44
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,341
‐Yes.

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,967
So that means he's the very top of the class.   ‐And he's good‐looking, too.

46
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,677
Today, for us new students,

47
00:03:14,677 --> 00:03:17,934
 you have organized a grand  ceremony to welcome us here,

48
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:20,001
and we are deeply grateful.

49
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,733
Wrapped in the warm rays of the spring sunshine...

50
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:25,367
[Hey, hey!

51
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,850
‐Huh?   ‐He's really good‐looking, isn't he?

52
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:30,425
Yeah. He might even be your type.

53
00:03:30,425 --> 00:03:32,025
My type, huh?

54
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:35,658
Well, I think you think he might be your type, too!

55
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:36,400
‐Humph!

56
00:03:37,575 --> 00:03:39,075
On behalf of all of us,

57
00:03:39,075 --> 00:03:41,075
 thank you for the opportunity.

58
00:03:48,325 --> 00:03:49,053
Hmm.

59
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,402
This again.

60
00:04:01,402 --> 00:04:03,525
This is happening more and more often.

61
00:04:03,925 --> 00:04:06,749
Not only am I at the top of the class academically,

62
00:04:06,749 --> 00:04:08,325
I'm one of the more attractive.

63
00:04:08,325 --> 00:04:10,492
It's impossible to not be popular.

64
00:04:11,225 --> 00:04:14,150
Sheesh! I'll just hurry them all on home.

65
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,125
 I'm sorry for calling you all the way out here.

66
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:18,750
Don't worry about it.

67
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:20,875
So, what did you want from me?

68
00:04:21,175 --> 00:04:24,200
I, um... I'm fine starting as just friends.

69
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:27,225
But can you maybe think about dating me, please?!

70
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,575
The thing is,

71
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:32,808
in order to keep my grades up at where they are now,

72
00:04:32,808 --> 00:04:35,441
I have to shave time from sleep to keep studying.

73
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't have the luxury of relationships.

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,846
So... I'm sorry.

75
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:43,000
Of course that's a pack of lies.

76
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,300
I don't study at all, ever.

77
00:04:45,775 --> 00:04:47,225
Oh, I see.

78
00:04:47,225 --> 00:04:48,625
I understand.

79
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:52,025
I'm sorry for calling you out like this so suddenly.

80
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:55,183
There's no way I would ever choose

81
00:04:55,183 --> 00:04:57,475
a plain, normal girl like you.

82
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,925
The one I'm after...

83
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,600
‐You mean you didn't watch that TV special last night? 

84
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,375
‐Huh‐uh.

85
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:07,125
...is the madonna of this school, of course.

86
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:10,075
Yumi Shirayanagi.

87
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:13,864
I will make... you mine!

88
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,175
I know I'll definitely get a chance.

89
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:19,625
It all lies in how I use the five seconds,

90
00:05:19,625 --> 00:05:22,225
which are the limits of my ability.

91
00:05:25,175 --> 00:05:26,300
That's it!

92
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:27,583
‐So then I...

93
00:05:27,583 --> 00:05:28,300
‐Huh?

94
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,675
 Mitchon, what's the matter?

95
00:05:48,775 --> 00:05:51,975
Did you see that? She almost got run over.

96
00:05:51,975 --> 00:05:52,775
Huh?

97
00:05:54,275 --> 00:05:55,725
It looks like the airbag saved him.

98
00:05:55,725 --> 00:05:56,950
I'm so glad.

99
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,858
That was close, but it went according to plan.

100
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,672
Oh, Yumi!

101
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:06,139
Are you all right?   ‐Yeah, that was really a close one.

102
00:06:06,750 --> 00:06:09,950
Yumi, you were about to be run over by a truck.

103
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:12,717
Otosaka from class one ran out and saved you.

104
00:06:12,975 --> 00:06:14,700
Really? Is that true?

105
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,275
Yeah. Are you hurt at all?

106
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,575
Ow!

107
00:06:18,575 --> 00:06:21,175
Let's go to the nurse. Can you walk?

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,875
Uh... yes.

109
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:30,183
Well, guess I'll go home.

110
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:31,675
Please, wait a minute!

111
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,575
Um, you see,

112
00:06:33,575 --> 00:06:36,150
 the two of us, we're just about to walk over

113
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:39,525
to our favorite restaurant to eat our favorite pancakes together.

114
00:06:39,525 --> 00:06:41,281
Would you like to come with us?

115
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,034
Sorry, I think I'm gonna pass.

116
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,483
It's better to keep this among friends.

117
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:50,125
But you just put yourself in danger in order to save my life.

118
00:06:50,125 --> 00:06:52,858
I'd like to properly repay that

119
00:06:52,858 --> 00:06:55,925
and I'd like to talk with you a little while longer.

120
00:06:58,150 --> 00:07:00,325
Whoa, I have a phone call. Who is it?

121
00:07:00,325 --> 00:07:02,675
Huh? Then I'll go home right away.

122
00:07:02,675 --> 00:07:04,908
Mitchon, what's the matter?

123
00:07:04,908 --> 00:07:07,375
My big brother suddenly came back from Kyoto

124
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,108
and he apparently ordered top‐end sushi for the whole family.

125
00:07:10,108 --> 00:07:12,842
So I'm leaving the rest to you two. Bye!

126
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,075
That was an obvious farce,

127
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:17,550
but a nice assist nonetheless, Mitchon.

128
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,475
Enjoy your meal !

129
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:29,725
Wait a sec, there's a special way to eat this.

130
00:07:29,725 --> 00:07:30,575
‐Uh...

131
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,025
‐Just copy me.

132
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,875
If you do this, the syrup gets across the entire thing.

133
00:07:36,175 --> 00:07:39,908
Then stack them up, cut them up,   and try a bite of it. cut them up, and try a bite of it.

134
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,425
Mmm!

135
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,059
Amazing. Just by changing how you eat it,

136
00:07:50,059 --> 00:07:53,950
I never realized. it gets this delicious?

137
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:57,750
  It's delicious every single time. 

138
00:07:58,925 --> 00:08:01,550
Uh... um...

139
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:05,175
The song they're playing right now is "How‐Low‐Hello," isn't it? 

140
00:08:05,525 --> 00:08:06,675
Huh? Hallow‐hello?

141
00:08:06,675 --> 00:08:08,675
You look like you've never heard of them. 

142
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:11,408
I thought every boy our age knew them really well. 

143
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:13,950
So that's what's popular nowadays? 

144
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:18,025
Otosaka, can we walk home together after school 

145
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,833
or go out to eat like this again sometime? 

146
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,117
Hmm... Sure, I guess. Why not?

147
00:08:25,175 --> 00:08:26,350
I'm so glad!

148
00:08:42,175 --> 00:08:44,450
I shouldn't do this out loud. 

149
00:08:44,450 --> 00:08:46,100
I'll hurry on over.

150
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:48,625
Yu Otosaka from class 1‐1,

151
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,892
please report immediately to the Student Council room. 

152
00:08:50,892 --> 00:08:52,625
‐I repeat...   ‐What's this? 

153
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,459
Yu Otosaka from class 1‐1, 

154
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,075
please report immediately to the Student Council room. 

155
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,850
I'm Student Council President Omura. 

156
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,500
What is it you want with me?

157
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,950
I'm making someone wait, so I'm hoping you can make this quick. 

158
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,983
That is completely up to you. 

159
00:09:07,983 --> 00:09:10,150
This is an exact copy of your answer sheet 

160
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,550
to the aptitude test you took the other day. 

161
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,483
You managed a perfect score.

162
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:17,075
The same test has been placed right there. 

163
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:20,450
Right here and now, try to get a perfect score again. 

164
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:23,216
Huh? Why do I have to take it again? 

165
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:26,575
You've been accused of possibly cheating on the exam. 

166
00:09:26,575 --> 00:09:29,575
If you score 90% or above, you're innocent. 

167
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:30,942
It not, you're guilty.

168
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:33,375
This is ridiculous. I'm leaving now. 

169
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,075
Regarding this, we have the support 

170
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,325
of both the principal and the vice‐principal. 

171
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,995
If you leave now, you will be expelled from school. 

172
00:09:40,995 --> 00:09:42,908
Expelled?!

173
00:09:42,908 --> 00:09:45,008
Now, please begin.

174
00:09:52,075 --> 00:09:54,075
All of the answers are right there. 

175
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:56,550
I'll just possess him and find out what they are. 

176
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,175
It's the only way.

177
00:10:02,925 --> 00:10:05,075
He's making a fool of me!

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,800
Huh? What in the world just happened? 

179
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,133
I don't know. It seemed like you were 

180
00:10:12,133 --> 00:10:13,900
just tearing whatever that was up. 

181
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,125
We got enough.

182
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,125
I'm Tomori, student council president. 

183
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:22,700
Of another school, though.

184
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:25,300
So, I've been recording you since you got here. 

185
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,667
Please take a look at the video I just recorded. 

186
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,600
and take a note of the time.

187
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,210
 You were not looking   at Omura the moment he ripped up the answer sheet. 

188
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:35,650
Yet you said he ripped it up.

189
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,300
Isn't that a bit strange?

190
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:39,534
I'll show you others.

191
00:10:40,725 --> 00:10:44,025
You have a special ability to possess other people. 

192
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:47,975
Using that, you cheat on every exam. 

193
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:49,900
Isn't that right?

194
00:10:50,475 --> 00:10:53,275
Th‐That's not true. It's a sleeping disease. 

195
00:10:53,275 --> 00:10:54,942
I suddenly get tremendously sleepy 

196
00:10:54,942 --> 00:10:56,850
and can't fight the urge to nod off.

197
00:10:57,125 --> 00:10:59,125
You really are troublesome.

198
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,125
  I'll show you this, then. Look. 

199
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,642
A copy of a recent medical exam. 

200
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,050
According to this, you have no disease. 

201
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,550
Now, please solve the problems on the test. 

202
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,050
I can't deal with this! Leave me alone! 

203
00:11:19,925 --> 00:11:21,175
There he goes.

204
00:11:21,175 --> 00:11:24,125
She even foresaw that things would end up this way. 

205
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:28,659
Huh? Well then. Everything from here on is my job. 

206
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:35,625
Start running! Right now!

207
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:38,400
Damn it!

208
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,775
Are you injured?

209
00:11:42,775 --> 00:11:45,408
No, I'm fine, but what's wrong with him? 

210
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:56,625
Huh?

211
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:25,775
What?! What the hell is going on here?! 

212
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:23,826
What the hell? What did you just do? 

213
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:26,050
‐That was teleportation. 

214
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,800
‐Teleportation? 

215
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,475
Yes. Just like it sounds.

216
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:31,750
I instantly move to another location. 

217
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,917
Only I can't stop where I want. 

218
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,150
Thanks to my special ability,

219
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:38,625
I don't know how many times I've been hospitalized. 

220
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,825
What a half‐assed ability.

221
00:13:41,746 --> 00:13:44,525
So, anyway, what are you planning on doing with me now? 

222
00:13:44,525 --> 00:13:47,400
We are having you transferred over to our school. 

223
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,250
Transfer?

224
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:55,618
In this world, there are many people who possess special powers. 

225
00:13:55,618 --> 00:13:57,050
‐You're not the only one.

226
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:57,675
‐What?

227
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,100
But those powers are somewhat like an illness caught during adolescence 

228
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:02,675
and will disappear in due time. 

229
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,775
Until it goes away, you will attend classes 

230
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:08,208
at the Hoshinoumi Academy with us. 

231
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:12,505
I already have permission from those that have parental authority over you. 

232
00:14:12,505 --> 00:14:13,900
‐You mean all this is...?

233
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,950
‐Is real.

234
00:14:15,825 --> 00:14:19,545
I gotta say, you seem like you'd be popular from just your good looks. 

235
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:23,025
Did you really need to play the genius by cheating as much as possible? 

236
00:14:23,025 --> 00:14:25,475
That's the real question here, isn't it? 

237
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:29,758
But, thanks to that, you were able to get close  to that female student  you were targeting. 

238
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:32,750
Damn you!

239
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:46,398
What the...? She disappeared?

240
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:48,325
‐That is her special ability.

241
00:14:48,325 --> 00:14:50,300
It can't be.

242
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,150
How can you just become invisible? 

243
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,383
Actually, to me it looks like

244
00:14:55,383 --> 00:14:57,878
you simply stood there . and let her punch you in the face

245
00:14:57,878 --> 00:15:01,350
No way. I was the only one that couldn't see her? 

246
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:02,275
Right.

247
00:15:02,275 --> 00:15:05,675
Her ability is to hide from visual recognition from one target. 

248
00:15:05,675 --> 00:15:08,975
Every other human can see her as normal. 

249
00:15:10,373 --> 00:15:12,300
Another half‐assed ability.

250
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,939
By the way, you will be

251
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:16,499
expected to serve on our student council as well. 

252
00:15:16,499 --> 00:15:17,139
Huh?

253
00:15:17,139 --> 00:15:18,400
‐Your ability is useful,

254
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,884
so I'd like for you to cooperate with us. 

255
00:15:21,275 --> 00:15:22,250
To do what?

256
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,676
 To threaten those that abuse their powers for no good, 

257
00:15:25,676 --> 00:15:26,850
just like you have.

258
00:15:27,175 --> 00:15:31,025
Because that is the kind of existence we are. 

259
00:15:33,175 --> 00:15:34,975
[Yu, weakly] I'm home.

260
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,875
Oh, hi! Welcome back home, Big Brother. 

261
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,364
Wow! What's wrong with your face? 

262
00:15:40,364 --> 00:15:44,400
Oh, well, I, um, had an accident in gym class? 

263
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,658
Oh, right, we got an amazing phone call from our uncle while you were gone. 

264
00:15:48,658 --> 00:15:51,175
He said that you and I were immediately going to be transferred 

265
00:15:51,175 --> 00:15:54,775
over to Hoshinoumi Academy's middle school   and high school as scholarship students. 

266
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,725
Is that really true, Big Brother? 

267
00:15:58,075 --> 00:15:59,525
Are you serious?

268
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:01,050
Yes, it's true.

269
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:03,808
Yay! This will be great for the house budget! 

270
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:07,575
And uncle is sending us   lots of tasty food so that we can celebrate. 

271
00:16:08,197 --> 00:16:10,696
But this means that you have to transfer schools. 

272
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:12,925
You're gonna have to say goodbye to all your friends. 

273
00:16:13,225 --> 00:16:16,596
Yeah, but we can use smart phones   to video‐chat with one another, 

274
00:16:16,596 --> 00:16:19,350
so it's not going to be all that big a deal. 

275
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,065
[Yu drily] I see.

276
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:25,975
Tonight's dinner is gonna be... ta‐da! 

277
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,809
Omelet rice: your favorite dish, Big Brother Yu. 

278
00:16:29,275 --> 00:16:30,550
This again?

279
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:33,498
I've told her a million times, it was only when I was little. 

280
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:36,325
Congratulations to us.

281
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:37,722
All right now, let's eat.

282
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:40,375
So sweet!

283
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:44,116
Using this pizza sauce as the secret ingredient 

284
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:47,400
must have been fitting for my tongue when I was just a little child. 

285
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:48,925
‐How is it? Is it tasty?

286
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,925
 ‐Yeah, it's tasty. 

287
00:16:50,925 --> 00:16:53,600
Wow, really? It's the first time I've wanted 

288
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,175
to eat Mom's omelet rice in a while. 

289
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:57,992
Our mom, huh?

290
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:00,843
Why would I even care about someone like that? 

291
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,550
Are you still upset?

292
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:04,025
Yeah, of course I am.

293
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:07,775
She selfishly divorced and shoved custody over to our uncle. 

294
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:12,425
I don't understand much of it, but I really wish you could be more forgiving. 

295
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:14,450
We don't have parents anymore. 

296
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:16,975
Our only family is you and me.

297
00:17:17,575 --> 00:17:18,650
I see.

298
00:17:19,175 --> 00:17:22,200
But do you want to know what I sometimes think? 

299
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,600
That there is one more family member out there somewhere. 

300
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,033
You and I are the only siblings we have. 

301
00:17:28,325 --> 00:17:30,325
Are you seeing someone in your dreams? 

302
00:17:30,575 --> 00:17:31,875
Hmm, you're right.

303
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,175
But... it's a really weird feeling, 

304
00:17:34,175 --> 00:17:36,108
as if it was actually true.

305
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:38,775
It's totally a dream.

306
00:17:42,275 --> 00:17:45,125
Hey, we've got to be up really early to move. 

307
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:46,450
You should go get some sleep.

308
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:49,850
Oh, can't I have just a bit more time, please? 

309
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:53,375
Ayu, you really love stars, don't you? 

310
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:57,850
You can see way off into the distance,    where people will never reach, you know. 

311
00:17:57,850 --> 00:18:01,066
I just think that, well, that it's an amazing thing. 

312
00:18:01,066 --> 00:18:04,300
You know, if you keep talking only about the stars at school, 

313
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:05,600
you'll end up isolated.

314
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,275
Really? Why is that?

315
00:18:07,275 --> 00:18:08,350
In my experience,

316
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:12,150
a better strategy is to try and liven up  the conversation, 

317
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:15,000
by talking about movies and TV shows instead of the stars. 

318
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,766
Experience? Strategy?

319
00:18:17,766 --> 00:18:20,799
It's OK if you don't get it. Go to sleep soon. 

320
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,175
Roger that.

321
00:18:36,925 --> 00:18:38,300
Whoa!

322
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:42,250
Wow!

323
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:45,275
This is an amazingly huge room!

324
00:18:45,307 --> 00:18:48,950
Will you and I really be able to use all this space alone, 

325
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:49,782
Big Brother?

326
00:18:49,782 --> 00:18:50,678
‐Uh, yeah.

327
00:18:50,678 --> 00:18:52,708
‐Thank you for your hard work. 

328
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,541
I may not be much, but please allow me to help. 

329
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:58,717
Hey, just let the moving company guys do it, OK? 

330
00:18:58,717 --> 00:19:01,700
I thought that I could at least be a little bit of help. 

331
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,800
But I shouldn't?

332
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,543
Don't take their jobs away from them. 

333
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,025
Oh, what an amazing way to look at this. 

334
00:19:07,025 --> 00:19:09,209
I never would have thought of that. 

335
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:13,325
So, what was going on with you the other day? 

336
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:15,358
That's something I can't say.

337
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:20,300
Anyway, I'm going to have to transfer over to Hoshinoumi Academy immediately. 

338
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,875
‐Huh?

339
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,487
‐I can't tell you why.

340
00:19:22,487 --> 00:19:24,275
It's kind of complicated.

341
00:19:24,275 --> 00:19:25,297
I'm sorry.

342
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,846
Until this ability goes away,

343
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:31,116
I can't be authorized to travel to an area unsupervised. 

344
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:35,600
If you could come out there to see me once in a while,   that would be great. 

345
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,200
Yeah, but that's just so far away. 

346
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,525
Maybe you can come here every so often and see me instead? 

347
00:19:41,525 --> 00:19:43,775
'Fraid not. I'm really sorry,

348
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:45,875
but I can't come on my own anymore. 

349
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,953
But why?

350
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:49,283
I'm not allowed to tell you that. 

351
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:53,091
I'm forced to not mention anything about any of this to others. 

352
00:19:54,275 --> 00:19:56,600
There's absolutely nothing I can do about it. 

353
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,650
I'm very grateful for what you've done. 

354
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:01,550
That feeling will never leave me. 

355
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:04,847
However, the fact is that you and I aren't dating yet, 

356
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,293
so for me to chase you in a one‐sided way like that 

357
00:20:08,293 --> 00:20:10,411
would make me feel like some kind of stalker. 

358
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:12,331
I really do feel bad about that.

359
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,400
But I can't come see you on my own. 

360
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:17,975
I understand.

361
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:20,725
From now on, let us walk our own separate ways. 

362
00:20:20,725 --> 00:20:22,495
What? But that means...?

363
00:20:22,495 --> 00:20:25,525
I will never forget the feeling I have towards you. 

364
00:20:25,525 --> 00:20:29,100
You saved my life that day, and I will forever be grateful. 

365
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,700
And that is all. 

366
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,800
This can't... 

367
00:20:32,825 --> 00:20:35,325
Thank you very much for saving me like you did. 

368
00:20:35,325 --> 00:20:37,250
I really do appreciate it.

369
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,950
But this is where I bid you a fond farewell. 

370
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:41,616
Best of luck to you.

371
00:20:45,475 --> 00:20:46,725
I got dumped!?

372
00:20:47,436 --> 00:20:48,500
Me?

373
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:52,975
Hello?

374
00:20:52,975 --> 00:20:56,225
‐Excuse me, I let myself in.

375
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,875
Why are you suddenly here?

376
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,825
It's tough with just two of you. 

377
00:21:00,825 --> 00:21:02,389
We came here to help out.

378
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,391
Oh, hi.

379
00:21:04,391 --> 00:21:07,325
Are all of you from the same high school as my big brother? 

380
00:21:07,325 --> 00:21:09,550
Yes. We're in the student council. 

381
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,300
My name is Takajo

382
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,825
and this is Tomori.

383
00:21:12,825 --> 00:21:16,600
Since it's after school now, we thought we should stop by  and see if we could help. 

384
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:17,966
You shouldn't have bothered.

385
00:21:17,966 --> 00:21:19,775
Can we help you out, please? 

386
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:22,427
Of course, we'd love to have your help. 

387
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,375
Hmm.

388
00:21:24,025 --> 00:21:26,250
Yeah, petty cunning.

389
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,731
So let's split up and get things done. 

390
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:29,575
Right!

391
00:21:30,675 --> 00:21:32,248
Thank you so much.

392
00:21:36,425 --> 00:21:39,947
Huh? This must be that    tasty food  our uncle sent  to congratulate us 

393
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:41,875
that Ayumi was talking about.

394
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,700
Whaaa...?

395
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,650
It's all instant ramen?!

396
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:52,100
I'll pretend I never saw this.

397
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,650
 Ayumi, can I show you a magic trick? 

398
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:57,447
Oh. Yeah, Tomori.

399
00:21:57,447 --> 00:21:58,663
I'd love to see one.

400
00:21:58,663 --> 00:22:00,071
Now, stay right there.

401
00:22:00,071 --> 00:22:01,550
I'll be back in just a second.

402
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:02,816
OK. What?

403
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:06,650
Huh?

404
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,950
That was amazing!

405
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:13,350
Even more amazing than the people who are on TV. 

406
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,075
Did you enjoy that?

407
00:22:16,075 --> 00:22:18,142
Don't use her ability to mess around. 

408
00:22:18,142 --> 00:22:20,142
You wowed her out of her senses. 

409
00:22:20,142 --> 00:22:22,300
If you're going to play, you have to go home. 

410
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,575
All right, fine.

411
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,383
Your big brother is scary.

412
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:28,316
Well, at least I appreciate you helping us. 

413
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,426
I guess it's time for us to excuse ourselves. 

414
00:22:32,426 --> 00:22:33,706
You're going home?

415
00:22:33,706 --> 00:22:35,168
But I'm going to make dinner

416
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:36,925
and I'd love it if you two would stay. 

417
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:38,402
We don't have enough dishes.

418
00:22:38,402 --> 00:22:40,475
‐Right, if he says so.

419
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:41,650
‐Oh!

420
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,450
It's all right,

421
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:44,992
'cause we'll meet again.

422
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:47,050
Hmm.

423
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,963
Oh! "How‐Low‐Hello."

424
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,587
So it is a fad after all.

425
00:22:57,587 --> 00:23:01,450
Ah, that's right! Yusa Nishimori, Yusarin. 

426
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,175
‐I think she's so cute.

427
00:23:04,797 --> 00:23:07,931
That something like this sells is a sign of the apocalypse. 

428
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:11,775
You know what, Big Brother?

429
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:14,425
My new school is literally right next to yours, 

430
00:23:14,425 --> 00:23:16,305
so I think that we should walk together. 

431
00:23:16,305 --> 00:23:18,550
People might think I have a thing for my sister. 

432
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,575
A thing for me?

433
00:23:19,575 --> 00:23:20,950
You brought me a present?

434
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,000
What? No.

435
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,230
Hoshinoumi, sea of stars.

436
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:27,030
What an absolutely wonderful name for a school. 

437
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:30,300
Yeah. It's a name that sounds like it was created 

438
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,825
with only you in mind. 

439
00:23:33,225 --> 00:23:33,900
Hmm?

440
00:23:38,225 --> 00:23:39,400
Hey.

441
00:23:41,975 --> 00:23:44,375
That night, I had a dream. 

442
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,051
I'm sure it was because of Ayumi's far‐fetched announcement. 

443
00:23:53,525 --> 00:23:56,091
But... who was that?
