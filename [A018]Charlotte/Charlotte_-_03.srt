1
00:00:05,056 --> 00:00:07,866
Sorry, but I overslept this morning and ran out of time.

2
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,676
So it's omelet rice again.

3
00:00:10,325 --> 00:00:13,150
Y‐You know, I don't need to bring lunch anymore.

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,151
Oh? Really? Why is that?

5
00:00:15,151 --> 00:00:18,088
Well, most of the guys don't bring their own lunches.

6
00:00:18,088 --> 00:00:19,750
They all go to the cafeteria.

7
00:00:19,750 --> 00:00:22,025
I'm going to be eating with them from now on.

8
00:00:23,225 --> 00:00:25,675
Too bad. I like to make your lunch.

9
00:00:25,675 --> 00:00:29,337
But, since I made it today, I want you to take it with you!

10
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:30,703
Uh, sure.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,727
There’s no way I'd be able to eat omelet rice

12
00:00:39,727 --> 00:00:42,245
with a message written on it in a classroom.

13
00:02:17,925 --> 00:02:19,100
Oh, good morning.

14
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,533
Yeah, good morning.

15
00:02:20,533 --> 00:02:22,702
You seem fairly spiritless today.

16
00:02:22,975 --> 00:02:26,278
No, this is about how low my spirit is all the time.

17
00:02:26,278 --> 00:02:27,479
Especially mornings.

18
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,949
Tell you what: at lunch today, I'm gonna buy you

19
00:02:29,949 --> 00:02:31,651
the limited edition beef tongue curry,

20
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,786
guaranteed to lift your spirits right up.

21
00:02:34,012 --> 00:02:36,515
Will you make it there in time to get a limited edition?

22
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:39,068
With my ability for speed, it'll be a piece of cake.

23
00:02:39,068 --> 00:02:40,348
Ah, that's right.

24
00:02:57,825 --> 00:02:58,300
Huh?

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,836
Hello, I've been waiting for you. Here you go.

26
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:05,900
Right now, I think it would be better   if we got you straight to the hospital.

27
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,825
Oh, I'm used to this. It happens all the time.

28
00:03:08,825 --> 00:03:10,404
I'm sorry to make you worry about me.

29
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:13,678
His ability is way too half‐assed.

30
00:03:18,103 --> 00:03:23,696
Ahhh! A flood of spices. This is how curry should be! Delicious!

31
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:25,964
I'm glad it exceeds your expectations.

32
00:03:26,425 --> 00:03:29,392
Curry is something that should be spicy, after all.

33
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:33,693
It's medium spicy, but is that the right level of spice for you?

34
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:36,162
The beef tongue melts in your mouth. It's the best!

35
00:03:36,162 --> 00:03:37,785
You must really love curry.

36
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:38,565
 Mm‐hmm.

37
00:03:38,565 --> 00:03:40,400
I'd actually forgotten how much.

38
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,899
OK. I understand.

39
00:03:46,371 --> 00:03:48,140
Our comrade is coming again.

40
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,275
We should head to the student council room.

41
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,775
Why does that guy always show up soaking wet?

42
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:06,025
He can't use his special ability unless   he gets soaking wet while fully clothed first.

43
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:08,458
What a cumbersome, half‐assed ability.

44
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,725
The ability is channeling.

45
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:18,976
What is "channeling"?

46
00:04:19,825 --> 00:04:20,721
Spiritualism.

47
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:23,874
Allowing dead individuals to possess them like shamans.

48
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:27,835
Someone who can really use that   as a special ability and not just a fraud?

49
00:04:27,835 --> 00:04:29,675
That’s pretty amazing.

50
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,398
One more: pyrokinesis.

51
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,025
I can't believe this person has two abilities.

52
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:41,662
I'd like to get moving and grab this one as quickly as possible.

53
00:04:41,662 --> 00:04:44,097
Wait, this is an ordinary road.

54
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:46,325
And is that supposed to mean something?

55
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,825
It means they're on the move.

56
00:04:47,825 --> 00:04:49,400
In the middle of a weekday?

57
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,167
Are they ditching school or something?

58
00:04:51,385 --> 00:04:53,025
But this road is troubling.

59
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:56,569
It'd be much better   if it wasn't a narrow alley that's not very popular.

60
00:04:57,017 --> 00:04:58,458
So, what’s the big deal?

61
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,890
Oh, well, we should head out there anyway.

62
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:08,825
Huh? This is the place?

63
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:09,475
Yes.

64
00:05:18,025 --> 00:05:19,275
What's the matter?

65
00:05:19,275 --> 00:05:22,403
It looks like that person must have been pretty desperate

66
00:05:22,403 --> 00:05:23,705
when they passed through here.

67
00:05:23,705 --> 00:05:24,475
How's that?

68
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,777
This side of the box has no dust on it.

69
00:05:26,878 --> 00:05:30,549
In other words, whoever it was ran through here   and bumped into this box.

70
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:34,052
What you're saying is that you think   this person was being chased.

71
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:36,218
Sounds like there was an incident.

72
00:05:36,218 --> 00:05:37,605
Another troublesome‐‐

73
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,121
For now we'll keep moving forward.

74
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,890
Two new sets of footprints.

75
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:45,458
One of them has a short stride

76
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,057
and the other one is quite a bit longer.

77
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,716
This totally indicates a girl being chased by an adult.

78
00:05:50,716 --> 00:05:51,814
We have to hurry.

79
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,825
Oh, that thing earlier?

80
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:06,375
What was it?

81
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:10,173
They were filming something   where an idol was being chased by a big guy.

82
00:06:10,173 --> 00:06:11,275
An idol?

83
00:06:11,275 --> 00:06:12,600
Let's see...

84
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,800
Right, it was Yusa Nishimori.

85
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,812
I've heard that name before.

86
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:17,300
Me too.

87
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:19,979
Yusarin?!

88
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,405
Oh, yeah. It's the idol that Ayumi likes.

89
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:24,150
So you know her?

90
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:25,825
She's the unbelievable lead vocalist

91
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:28,260
for the band How‐Low‐Hello and an upcoming gorgeous super idol

92
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:31,025
that sings and dances like no one I've ever seen in my life!

93
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:34,115
I can't tell you what a big turnoff that is. Stop!

94
00:06:34,627 --> 00:06:37,379
Her career started in the sixth grade   when she won the grand prize

95
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:40,049
in the 14th reader‐model audition for the magazine Petit Banana

96
00:06:40,049 --> 00:06:41,984
and debuted as their exclusive model!

97
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:45,664
Then she landed a job as a regular member   of the "Movement Morning!" show

98
00:06:45,664 --> 00:06:48,550
but quit two years later to focus on school.

99
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,450
She restarted her career in show biz after‐‐

100
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,985
Hold it. Let's get back to the point.

101
00:06:52,985 --> 00:06:55,838
So that girl caused some issue with her special ability

102
00:06:55,838 --> 00:06:57,873
and became a fugitive, am I wrong?

103
00:06:57,873 --> 00:07:01,209
You really don't have to say   that for us to know it. ‐[Yu groans]

104
00:07:01,209 --> 00:07:03,345
Her agency is Sea Rex Productions.

105
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:05,250
Wouldn't it be quicker if we just called them?

106
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,600
We're talking show biz here. They're not gonna tell us anything.

107
00:07:09,475 --> 00:07:10,850
Then what should we do?

108
00:07:11,422 --> 00:07:12,750
Let's see.

109
00:07:14,622 --> 00:07:16,815
A suspicious target. I'll chase him!

110
00:07:22,675 --> 00:07:23,942
Tomori!

111
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:25,650
Otosaka, use your ability!

112
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:26,502
Huh?

113
00:07:37,446 --> 00:07:39,825
I'm the one who actually feels the pain,

114
00:07:39,825 --> 00:07:42,800
so I'd rather you not use this tactic from now on.

115
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,550
This is why we get compensation.

116
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:45,375
What?

117
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,675
That hurt.

118
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:51,300
Damn it, what would you have done if the camcorder broke?

119
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,378
That's your issue?

120
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:54,625
Wake up, bastard.

121
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:57,850
Who the hell are you?

122
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,500
No, who the hell are you?

123
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:04,153
Tell us what we wanna know and we'll call an ambulance for you.

124
00:08:04,153 --> 00:08:06,841
You realize you're headed straight to death right now?

125
00:08:07,325 --> 00:08:10,028
I was just offered a job, all right?

126
00:08:10,028 --> 00:08:11,075
What kind?

127
00:08:11,075 --> 00:08:12,821
Sorry, I can't tell you that.

128
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:16,658
Is it something you're willing to lose your life to protect?

129
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,850
I'm looking for Yusa Nishimori.

130
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,575
And who asked you to do that?

131
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:26,563
Taiyo TV.

132
00:08:26,563 --> 00:08:28,306
Right. What was their name?

133
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:32,050
I don't know the person's name. And that's the truth.

134
00:08:33,925 --> 00:08:38,150
Great, understood. I'd already called for   an ambulance before you talked.

135
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:47,975
Hey. What the hell are you guys?

136
00:08:49,975 --> 00:08:53,000
Just some people looking for a woman named Yusa Nishimori.

137
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,469
Her nickname is Yusarin!

138
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:55,871
Why are you looking?

139
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,982
I don't exactly know the reason why,

140
00:08:57,982 --> 00:09:01,359
but it's a fact that she's being chased,   so we thought we'd help her out.

141
00:09:01,359 --> 00:09:02,850
You guys know Yusa?

142
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:04,150
I'm a huge fan!

143
00:09:04,225 --> 00:09:06,275
Would you stop interrupting?

144
00:09:06,275 --> 00:09:09,250
I was watching you. How the hell did you defeat that guy?

145
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,619
We did it using special abilities.

146
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:14,450
Probably a lot like the ability Nishimori has.

147
00:09:15,906 --> 00:09:17,325
How do you know about that?

148
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:21,193
If you just trust us, I believe we can help save her from harm.

149
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,801
I see. I'm gonna need to see some proof.

150
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:28,425
Show me that you have the same power that she does.

151
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:30,665
It's not exactly the same power, but...

152
00:09:30,665 --> 00:09:32,133
What the...?

153
00:09:33,175 --> 00:09:33,950
Here.

154
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,927
Now do you believe what I'm saying?

155
00:09:37,927 --> 00:09:40,679
Yeah. Come on, I'll take you to her.

156
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:43,350
Though it's a bit confusing.

157
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,650
What do you mean by that?

158
00:09:44,928 --> 00:09:47,150
Things got slightly complicated.

159
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,280
I want you guys to see for yourselves.

160
00:09:53,212 --> 00:09:55,452
So this is a nightclub.

161
00:09:59,996 --> 00:10:02,850
You really don't have to film all this, do ya?

162
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:05,050
This way. And don’t lag behind.

163
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,886
Hey, I'm back.

164
00:10:06,886 --> 00:10:08,950
So how is everything outside today?

165
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:14,725
Ohh! It actually is the real Yusarin!

166
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:17,052
I have all the How‐Low‐Hello CDs.

167
00:10:17,052 --> 00:10:18,250
Big turnoff!

168
00:10:18,525 --> 00:10:20,646
Thanks so much, that's wonderful.

169
00:10:20,646 --> 00:10:23,125
It really is the girl I saw on TV.

170
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,262
Hey, what is with those guys?

171
00:10:25,262 --> 00:10:28,534
They're just like Misa and   have special abilities that they can use.

172
00:10:28,534 --> 00:10:32,734
Wait a minute, I thought her name was Yusa,   but it's actually Misa?

173
00:10:32,734 --> 00:10:35,102
That's the part that makes this complicated.

174
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:37,614
What are you doing? You sure we can trust them?

175
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:40,870
I watched them use their powers   to defeat those other guys, all right?

176
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:43,973
Is it OK if we ask her directly what's going on here?

177
00:10:44,335 --> 00:10:47,621
If you ask something stupid,   you're not getting out of here in one piece.

178
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:49,236
Why you gotta be so scary?

179
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,845
Tomori, be really careful here.

180
00:10:51,845 --> 00:10:52,997
Yeah, yeah.

181
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,391
It's very nice to meet you. I'm Tomori.

182
00:10:55,391 --> 00:11:00,155
I'm Yusa Nishimori, nicknamed Yusarin.   It's very nice to meet you.

183
00:11:00,155 --> 00:11:02,015
So she calls herself Yusarin?

184
00:11:02,209 --> 00:11:05,087
This is the first time in my life I've met a real idol.

185
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:08,603
You're so unbelievably cute, you almost look like a doll.

186
00:11:08,603 --> 00:11:10,998
I want to get as close to you as she is.

187
00:11:10,998 --> 00:11:11,782
Hey, back off!

188
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:15,185
Now, now. So first off,   could you please tell me your actual name?

189
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:16,870
It's Yusa Kurobane.

190
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,629
Yeah? Well, I wasn't asking you!

191
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:21,401
Your real name sounds more like a stage name.

192
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,235
Yes. I hear that a lot.

193
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:25,217
But Kurobane means "black feathers,"

194
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,106
and it's not really suitable for an idol,

195
00:11:27,106 --> 00:11:29,420
so they renamed me Nishimori.

196
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,426
That makes sense.

197
00:11:30,426 --> 00:11:32,289
Now, there are some occasions

198
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:34,120
when you are not Yusa Kurobane.

199
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,784
Are you aware of that fact?

200
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:38,209
No, she's not, so how do you know about it?

201
00:11:38,209 --> 00:11:39,798
I wasn't asking you, bastard.

202
00:11:39,798 --> 00:11:40,459
What was that?

203
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:42,640
So, was I right about that, Kurobane?

204
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,822
That's exactly it. I guess you can call it sleepwalking.

205
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:48,281
I've been falling asleep without realizing it,

206
00:11:48,281 --> 00:11:52,268
and then when I wake up,  I'm somewhere else, with no idea how I got there.

207
00:11:52,268 --> 00:11:55,003
The doctors who examined me said there's a chance that I have

208
00:11:55,003 --> 00:11:57,175
a multiple personality disorder.

209
00:11:57,175 --> 00:11:58,522
Oh, they did, huh?

210
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:01,620
Well, it's not schizophrenia,   so you don't have to worry about that.

211
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:12,316
She has her own special ability just like the three of us.

212
00:12:12,316 --> 00:12:15,753
Her power is to allow a dead person to possess her body.

213
00:12:16,037 --> 00:12:17,186
Seriously?

214
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:20,364
I believe that the ability is calling forth this Misa girl

215
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,395
that you guys were talking about earlier.

216
00:12:22,395 --> 00:12:23,487
Misa?

217
00:12:23,487 --> 00:12:24,571
Is something the matter?

218
00:12:24,571 --> 00:12:25,595
Don't ask anything.

219
00:12:25,815 --> 00:12:27,595
Is it someone she knew?

220
00:12:28,446 --> 00:12:30,615
Yeah, she was Yusa's older sister.

221
00:12:30,822 --> 00:12:33,694
She died six months ago in an accident.

222
00:12:34,764 --> 00:12:36,334
You bastard.

223
00:12:36,334 --> 00:12:38,367
Don't go blabbing on about things

224
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,687
to some stranger you just met!

225
00:12:42,347 --> 00:12:44,423
Can I assume that you're Misa?

226
00:12:44,423 --> 00:12:47,879
It's so annoying how cramped it is with all of you here!

227
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,799
She’s totally changed.

228
00:12:56,345 --> 00:12:58,731
Whoa, that's really impressive.

229
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:02,229
Calm down, Misa! You're gonna burn us all to death!

230
00:13:05,958 --> 00:13:07,837
I suppose that wouldn't be good.

231
00:13:11,108 --> 00:13:12,900
I'm very surprised.

232
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,320
It seems she can't call forth the spirit on her own

233
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,124
and that Misa is in control.

234
00:13:17,124 --> 00:13:18,792
So you got a problem with that?

235
00:13:18,792 --> 00:13:21,161
Another ability that's somehow half‐assed.

236
00:13:21,398 --> 00:13:24,598
That means she has an unparalleled ability to be possessed.

237
00:13:25,044 --> 00:13:28,758
And Misa, who possesses Yusa, has pyrokinetic ability.

238
00:13:29,469 --> 00:13:30,303
Yeah.

239
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,831
So, what is your relationship with these two?

240
00:13:33,391 --> 00:13:36,870
They're my friends from back   when I was alive and still causing trouble.

241
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:39,839
Do you have any idea why your little sister is being chased?

242
00:13:41,275 --> 00:13:42,712
Yeah. 'Cause of this.

243
00:13:43,186 --> 00:13:46,239
Yusa accidentally brought this home from some shoot.

244
00:13:46,239 --> 00:13:49,503
It belongs to one of the bigger‐name producers   at the TV station.

245
00:13:49,561 --> 00:13:52,558
And she accidentally read a text that was sent to it.

246
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:55,916
Stealing company money, organized crime connections.

247
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:59,084
Stuff that would get the guy arrested   if it was taken to the cops.

248
00:13:59,084 --> 00:14:01,004
Did you guys think to turn the power off?

249
00:14:01,004 --> 00:14:03,884
Yeah. But it was on until yesterday.

250
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,912
Then they probably already know

251
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:08,915
that you're hiding somewhere in this area from the GPS.

252
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:12,151
Even if you gave the phone back now, you wouldn't be safe.

253
00:14:12,368 --> 00:14:14,538
And, if you gave it to the police,

254
00:14:14,538 --> 00:14:17,235
it would look like Kurobane sold out the producer

255
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:19,457
and could keep her from working in show biz.

256
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:22,625
OK, I'll burn it down, station and all.

257
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:26,341
Are you stupid? You do that,   and your little sister will end up in prison!

258
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:28,216
Who the hell do you think you are, huh?

259
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:32,376
Do you really want to do something   that will land her a stint in juvenile hall?

260
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:35,342
That would make absolutely no sense.

261
00:14:35,342 --> 00:14:38,606
Now please calm down. You want to save your sister, right?

262
00:14:38,606 --> 00:14:40,574
Huh? Yes, of course.

263
00:14:40,574 --> 00:14:42,355
Then we should help each other

264
00:14:42,355 --> 00:14:44,744
turn the tables on this guy and threaten him instead.

265
00:14:44,744 --> 00:14:45,573
Huh?

266
00:14:46,693 --> 00:14:47,846
Can we win?

267
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,725
I'm really good at creating wonderfully devious plans

268
00:14:50,725 --> 00:14:53,178
for threatening others, so you can trust me.

269
00:14:53,178 --> 00:14:55,080
You've got spunk.

270
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:57,858
All right then, I'll do whatever you say.

271
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:00,174
I'd like the both of you to help as well.

272
00:15:00,174 --> 00:15:03,705
Of course we will, if Misa says so.

273
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,802
Oh my, I didn't fall asleep again just now, did I?

274
00:15:07,802 --> 00:15:10,682
You must be really tired, that's all, it's all right.

275
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:13,106
Why don't you have some roasted marshmallows and relax?

276
00:15:13,106 --> 00:15:16,541
Oh! The marshmallows turned into freshly roasted ones.

277
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:20,447
This is unbearable.

278
00:15:20,447 --> 00:15:23,306
I have no clue how I should approach Yusarin from now on.

279
00:15:23,306 --> 00:15:26,545
Every picture I had in my head about her has been blown.

280
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:27,869
You're a scary guy.

281
00:15:27,869 --> 00:15:30,606
First we should head to a shop that sells work clothes.

282
00:15:30,606 --> 00:15:31,665
What for?

283
00:15:31,851 --> 00:15:34,928
You two are going to need a set of fireproof clothing.

284
00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:45,240
It's me.

285
00:15:55,845 --> 00:15:56,569
Huh?

286
00:15:57,273 --> 00:15:59,423
So you finally showed up.

287
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:01,798
Realize that you couldn't escape?

288
00:16:01,798 --> 00:16:05,539
Um, I really don't know the reason why I'm being chased so much.

289
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,739
Did I do something wrong?

290
00:16:08,099 --> 00:16:09,507
Give me back my phone!

291
00:16:09,863 --> 00:16:11,191
Is this the one?

292
00:16:11,191 --> 00:16:12,095
Yeah.

293
00:16:12,095 --> 00:16:15,906
Even if I return it to you now, am I, like, still in trouble?

294
00:16:15,906 --> 00:16:19,877
Whatever happens, there's no future   for you in this industry anymore.

295
00:16:19,877 --> 00:16:22,114
There's no more future for me?

296
00:16:22,882 --> 00:16:26,274
Bastard! The one who has no future is you!

297
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,115
I think I'll take out one more!

298
00:16:37,235 --> 00:16:40,046
What the... What the hell's going on?

299
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:42,849
You probably thought that you had me cornered tonight,

300
00:16:42,849 --> 00:16:47,087
but you didn't realize that   it was me that had you cornered all along.

301
00:16:47,412 --> 00:16:49,915
You really are senseless, you know?

302
00:16:50,187 --> 00:16:51,733
What the hell are you?

303
00:16:51,997 --> 00:16:54,869
I mean, are you really Yusa Nishimori?

304
00:16:54,869 --> 00:16:58,743
Of course, I'm Yusa Nishimori, the real Yusarin, who else?

305
00:16:58,743 --> 00:17:01,207
And in order to ensure my success,

306
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:04,228
I'm willing to kill anyone who gets in my way, like them!

307
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:06,820
That hurts!

308
00:17:07,091 --> 00:17:10,803
This is getting boring. I'll get rid of them all at once.

309
00:17:14,201 --> 00:17:16,243
W‐Wait, wait, wait. Just a minute. Hold on, please.

310
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,857
Like I'm gonna wait! ‐[producer groans]

311
00:17:25,725 --> 00:17:27,986
What the hell is going on here?

312
00:17:27,986 --> 00:17:32,402
I can bury you in the shadows at any point I want, understand?

313
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:34,233
I get it, I give up.

314
00:17:34,233 --> 00:17:35,359
 Please, don't hurt me.

315
00:17:35,359 --> 00:17:36,972
I'll give this back to you.

316
00:17:37,484 --> 00:17:39,532
But there is no next time.

317
00:17:40,748 --> 00:17:42,924
I'll eradicate you in a heartbeat.

318
00:17:51,308 --> 00:17:53,283
Thank you very much for all your help.

319
00:17:53,283 --> 00:17:55,267
No, you helped us.

320
00:17:55,907 --> 00:17:58,106
He believed that everything that happened tonight

321
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:59,962
was done by Yusa all on her own.

322
00:18:00,499 --> 00:18:03,610
That producer will never dare to go up against her again.

323
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,386
No, I'm afraid everything is not completely settled yet.

324
00:18:10,074 --> 00:18:13,029
And so I'd like you to transfer into Hoshinoumi Academy

325
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:16,589
and do everything you do alongside us from now on.

326
00:18:16,589 --> 00:18:17,873
Why would she do that?

327
00:18:17,873 --> 00:18:19,908
Just like how I explained earlier.

328
00:18:19,908 --> 00:18:23,477
If she gets caught by the scientists,   her days as a guinea pig will begin

329
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,629
and she will never be able to   return to a normal life, understand?

330
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:29,829
The condo next to our academy will be the safest place

331
00:18:30,024 --> 00:18:33,925
for Kurobane to continue to grow   and live something of a normal existence.

332
00:18:35,333 --> 00:18:37,829
That's a life‐saving story for Yusa.

333
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:39,237
We'll do that.

334
00:18:39,621 --> 00:18:40,259
Hold on!

335
00:18:40,904 --> 00:18:42,292
Then, well...

336
00:18:42,292 --> 00:18:44,393
If Yusa's powers disappear,

337
00:18:44,393 --> 00:18:47,138
does that also mean we'll never see Misa again?

338
00:18:47,138 --> 00:18:49,826
Yeah, that's exactly what I wanted to ask.

339
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:51,543
Well, I suppose that will happen,

340
00:18:51,543 --> 00:18:53,444
but she's already dead, isn't she?

341
00:18:53,444 --> 00:18:56,514
Isn't it amazing that you were able to see her at all?

342
00:18:56,514 --> 00:18:57,356
But

343
00:18:57,356 --> 00:18:59,356
Sho, it's just like she says.

344
00:18:59,356 --> 00:19:01,680
In reality, she's not here.

345
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:05,117
It's time to say goodbye and let her go.

346
00:19:08,336 --> 00:19:11,997
Then at least let me tell her how I truly feel about her.

347
00:19:16,563 --> 00:19:17,066
Hmm?

348
00:19:18,393 --> 00:19:21,487
Well, uh... How do I put this?

349
00:19:23,343 --> 00:19:25,834
Now is when I can't think of what I should say?

350
00:19:25,834 --> 00:19:29,483
Huh? Sho? Did you used to have the hots for me?

351
00:19:30,963 --> 00:19:31,540
Uh...

352
00:19:33,055 --> 00:19:34,161
That's right.

353
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:36,771
I really loved you, Misa.

354
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:38,690
It's embarrassing to say...

355
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:40,979
but I was in love

356
00:19:40,979 --> 00:19:43,647
and you passed away before I could tell you.

357
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:47,212
We had a motorcycle accident while we were riding together.

358
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:51,116
I was OK, but I was the one that killed you.

359
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:52,718
It's my fault.

360
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:55,988
I see. It's all right.

361
00:19:56,808 --> 00:19:59,944
I made you harbor such immense feelings inside,

362
00:20:00,387 --> 00:20:03,208
but I was the one that looked for dangerous thrills.

363
00:20:03,489 --> 00:20:05,217
I reaped what I sowed.

364
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,910
Don't cry, that's not like you at all.

365
00:20:12,084 --> 00:20:13,681
Sho, forget about me.

366
00:20:13,681 --> 00:20:16,759
And starting tomorrow, live your own life.

367
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:20,087
And don't keep dragging the dead into it.

368
00:20:20,087 --> 00:20:22,999
Otherwise, your life will get screwed up

369
00:20:22,999 --> 00:20:25,271
and you won't be happy in the future, OK?

370
00:20:26,573 --> 00:20:29,271
Jeez, you really are a troublesome boy.

371
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,305
Sho.

372
00:20:32,534 --> 00:20:34,326
All right, Misa.

373
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,294
I'll walk my own path that you're not a part of.

374
00:20:39,318 --> 00:20:41,214
I'll sever my feelings for you.

375
00:20:41,214 --> 00:20:43,011
And that's how I'll live on.

376
00:20:43,407 --> 00:20:45,852
Good. And I hope that both of you

377
00:20:45,852 --> 00:20:47,408
live very long and happy lives.

378
00:20:48,334 --> 00:20:48,950
Yeah.

379
00:20:49,551 --> 00:20:50,426
Sure.

380
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:53,727
See ya! And thanks for everything.

381
00:20:53,727 --> 00:20:57,130
'Cause it was absolutely great!

382
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:03,418
It was a really long day.

383
00:21:03,418 --> 00:21:04,408
I'm exhausted.

384
00:21:05,112 --> 00:21:07,123
You are so late!

385
00:21:07,123 --> 00:21:08,501
If you're going to be this late,

386
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,664
I told you that I wanted you to call!

387
00:21:10,664 --> 00:21:11,838
How about you?

388
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:13,872
What are you doing up at this hour?

389
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:16,614
Eating dinner together as a family is a rule

390
00:21:16,614 --> 00:21:19,584
that's been passed down the Otosaka house for generations.

391
00:21:19,584 --> 00:21:23,369
Sorry, I was busy again today   doing work for the student council.

392
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:27,224
Aww. When you say that to me, I can't say anything back.

393
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:29,912
So tell me, what is it you made for dinner tonight?

394
00:21:29,912 --> 00:21:32,984
I made a very satisfying spaghetti with meat sauce.

395
00:21:38,856 --> 00:21:41,524
Oh! It's How‐Low‐Hello again!

396
00:21:50,357 --> 00:21:53,237
Wow, it really is the same person that I met today.

397
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:55,874
Huh? Who exactly are you talking about?

398
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:58,410
You know, Yusa Nishimori, the actual person.

399
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,747
You mean the real one?   So you've actually gotten to meet Yusarin?

400
00:22:01,747 --> 00:22:05,483
Oh, crap! But they didn't tell me to stay quiet about this.

401
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:07,339
So I guess I can tell her.

402
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:10,382
She's transferring into my academy tomorrow.

403
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:13,326
What? Oh, that makes me so jealous!

404
00:22:13,326 --> 00:22:15,822
Do you think that maybe I'll be able to meet her soon?

405
00:22:15,822 --> 00:22:18,525
Well, I guess that certainly is a possibility.

406
00:22:18,999 --> 00:22:20,537
Wow!

407
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:21,471
Oh, wow.

408
00:22:21,471 --> 00:22:23,323
Let's start by cleaning up your nosebleed.

409
00:22:23,323 --> 00:22:26,368
It's just something that's so amazing!

410
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:30,080
Come on, you're getting way too excited about this.
